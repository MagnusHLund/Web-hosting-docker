# Testing the API

The files within these sub directories can be used to perform API calls, within VS code!

To use the network requests from these files, install the 'REST Client' by 'Huachao Mao' VS Code extension.

Get it here: [Visual studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client)

Some endpoints needs a valid authentication cookie. To retrieve this, use the login endpoint.
